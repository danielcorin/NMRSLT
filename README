#NMRSLT
NMRSLT is a utility programmed in python using scipy and matplotlib
to assist students and new researchers in understanding the link
between the time and frequency domains in NMR spectroscopy.

The plot window displays a mathematically generated, two component
Gaussian-sine wave product. The parameters of each of these components
can be varied using the sliders and radio buttons. The time and frequency
plots are updated as the parameters are varied with the sliders, allowing
one to observe the broadening, narrowing, and shifting of peaks in the
frequency domain as well as interference patterns in the time domain.
